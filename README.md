# Split Share cli

## Introduction

Ever struggled to split the dinner expenses with your friends?
Or maybe got sick of adding and subtracting numbers from every one's share until
you realize that you lost the track of the process and have to start over?

<b>Split Share</b> got your back! In this simple cli software you can easily calculate
every one's shares in an event.

## How to use

Just clone this repo and enter:

```bash
make run
```

1. First, you can choose to load the event from a file which was saved by this very app before.

2. Then you have to enter the members involved in the event by name.  
   `NOTICE`: All the names in this step and the steps to come are case sensitive.

3. Enter each purchase record by naming the member who did the purchase and the amount

4. You can optionaly save this data to disk for later use

5. Describe the event results

Enjoy!

## Ideas for further development

- Writing proper tests
- Adding a GUI, maybe for android, ios or even as a web app
- Adding the ability to include or exclude current members from a purchase record
